# HAI Intel

A Next.js + TypeScript app for viewing and auditing reports. It includes a PDF viewer, scorecards and performance goals, an audit/suggestion section, and a small chat widget used in the UI.

This README explains how to run and develop the project locally, where to find core files, and a few troubleshooting tips.

## Quick start (PowerShell)

1. Install dependencies

   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server (uses Turbopack as configured in the scripts)

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Available npm scripts

- `npm run dev` — starts Next.js in development with the `--turbopack` flag
- `npm run build` — builds the production bundle (`next build --turbopack`)
- `npm run start` — runs the production server after a build
- `npm run lint` — runs ESLint

These are defined in `package.json`.

## Project structure (important files)

- `src/app/page.tsx` — main application page; edit to change the root page
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — app layout and global wrappers
- `src/app/globals.css` — global styles
- `src/app/components/chat_widget.tsx` — chat widget used in the UI
- `src/app/components/layout/*` — header, footer, navigation and mobile menu
- `src/app/components/sections/AuditSection.tsx` — audit-related UI
- `src/app/components/sections/SuggestionSection.tsx` — suggestion UI
- `src/app/components/ui/PDFViewer.tsx` — embedded PDF viewer (uses files from `public/pdfs/`)
- `src/app/components/ui/PerformanceGoals.tsx` — performance goals UI
- `src/app/components/ui/Scorecard.tsx` — scorecard UI
- `src/data/reportData.ts` — sample or seeded data used by the UI
- `public/pdfs/` — bundled PDFs referenced by the app (e.g. `hai_desktop_expanded.pdf`)

## Notes about tooling

- This project uses Next.js (v15.x), TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. ESLint is configured for the project.
- Dev/build scripts include the `--turbopack` flag. Turbopack is fast but can be experimental; if you encounter issues, remove `--turbopack` from the script in `package.json` and try again.

## Editing and extending

- To add pages, follow the Next.js app router conventions inside `src/app/`.
- Reusable UI components live in `src/app/components/` and are grouped by purpose (`layout/`, `sections/`, `ui/`).
- Static assets can be added to `public/` (images, PDFs, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

- If the dev server fails to start, check your Node.js version (use a recent LTS — Node 18+ is recommended for modern Next releases).
- If lint fails, run `npm run lint` and follow ESLint suggestions. You can run `npx eslint --fix <file>` to auto-fix some issues.

## Deploy

This app deploys normally to Vercel (recommended). The `next` and `eslint-config-next` versions in `package.json` are already compatible with deploying to Vercel.

## Contributing

This repository is currently private. If you'd like help adding tests, CI, or a component library, open an issue or request and I can add a suggested plan.

- 🎯 **Zero Layout Shift** ensures visual stability
- 🎯 No console errors or deprecation warnings

## 🚨 Root Cause Analysis

### Why is Mobile Performance So Poor?

The **29.3s Speed Index** on mobile reveals several compounding issues:

1. **Network Constraints** - Mobile networks have higher latency and lower bandwidth
2. **Render Blocking** - 1,300ms of blocking resources prevent initial paint
3. **JavaScript Processing** - Mobile CPUs are slower at parsing/executing JS
4. **No Mobile Optimization** - Identical assets served to mobile and desktop
5. **Long Tasks** - 6 long tasks block main thread during critical rendering
6. **Resource Discovery** - Delayed LCP request discovery

## 🎯 Prioritized Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: CRITICAL - Mobile Performance (Week 1-2)
**Target: Mobile Performance 70 → 85+**

- [ ] **Eliminate render-blocking resources** (saves 1,300ms)
  - Defer non-critical CSS
  - Async non-critical JavaScript
  - Inline critical CSS
- [ ] **Implement code splitting** for mobile bundles
- [ ] **Add responsive images** with srcset/sizes
- [ ] **Break up long tasks** (reduce from 6 to 2 or fewer)
- [ ] **Add resource hints** (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
- [ ] **Defer offscreen images** (saves 7 KiB)

**Expected Impact:** 
- Speed Index: 29.3s → <4s (86% improvement)
- LCP: 3.9s → <2.5s
- TBT: 150ms → <100ms

### Phase 2: HIGH - Accessibility (Week 2-3)
**Target: Desktop 90 → 100, Mobile 86 → 95+**

  - Large text: 3:1 ratio
- [ ] **Add button labels** (mobile-specific issue)
  - Use aria-label or visible text
- [ ] **Name all links** with descriptive text/aria-labels
- [ ] **Fix heading hierarchy** (proper H1 → H2 → H3 structure)

### Phase 3: MEDIUM - Cross-Platform Optimization (Week 3-4)
**Target: Desktop 90 → 95+, Mobile 85 → 90+**

- [ ] **Reduce document latency**
  - Desktop: 1,070ms → <500ms
  - Mobile: 1,510ms → <600ms
- [ ] **Implement aggressive caching**
  - Desktop: save 353 KiB
  - Mobile: save 225 KiB
- [ ] **Remove unused JavaScript**
  - Desktop: 139 KiB
  - Mobile: 98 KiB
- [ ] **Optimize third-party scripts**

### Phase 4: LOW - Security & Polish (Week 5-6)
**Target: Maintain 100/100 Best Practices**

- [ ] Implement CSP headers for XSS protection
- [ ] Add HSTS policy
